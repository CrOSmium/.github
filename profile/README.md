</br><h2 align="center">What do we do?</h2>
We make tools and utilities to help you mess with your devices easier, and without having to well.. do anything yourself (or look to AI [ew, vibecoding])
</br></br>We have a primary focus on ChromeOS and Chromebooks, but we are willing to branch out and look to other platforms to make stuff for (ChromeOS is just a starting point for OSmium and we plan to go further in making our utilities outside of it someday!)
